# Handheld AR application using AR.js and A-Frame

The still in development application can be found here: https://georgebeeley.github.io/AR.js/.

The purpose of this project is to create an application that enables the visualisation of periodic table elements in augmented reality using positionable markers. Upon close proximity of the two markers holding two molecules they should animatedly combine to create a compound element of the two starting molecules.

It should be designed to allow extendability of adding additional elements from the periodic table and compound element possibilites.

Current usage requires the markers shown below:

Marker A                   |  Marker B
:-------------------------:|:-------------------------:

Images can be downloaded and used as targets without printing by displaying them on your monitor. Being able to reposition the markers is beneficial to make the most of the applications features as they interact with one another based on proximity.
