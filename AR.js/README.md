# Handheld AR application using AR.js and A-Frame

The still in development application can be found here: https://georgebeeley.github.io/AR.js.

Current usage requires the markers shown below:

Marker A                   |  Marker B
:-------------------------:|:-------------------------:
![A](https://github.com/GeorgeBeeley/georgebeeley.github.io/blob/master/AR.js/images/marker_a.png)  | ![B](https://github.com/GeorgeBeeley/georgebeeley.github.io/blob/master/AR.js/images/marker_b.png)

Images can be downloaded and used as targets without printing by displaying them on your monitor. Being able to reposition the markers is beneficial to make the most of the applications features as they interact with one another based on proximity.
