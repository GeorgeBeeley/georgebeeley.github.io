Fonts used in p5.js Processing canvases require the site to be hosted, not just viewed as HTML.
There are currently issues viewing the fonts on Chrome which were not experienced during development and testing, so I recommend using Firefox to view without issue.

The animation was developed on a monitor with screen resolution 1920*1080, so may appear malformed on other resolutions.
I plan to resolve this in future.
